Hi there!

Someone replied to a message you sent through the CLOGS Membership database. That reply is below, and any attachments have been forwarded on.

Please DO NOT reply to this email! This email has come from the database too, and it'll just get very confusing. Instead, create a new email to the actual sender if you need to contact them.
